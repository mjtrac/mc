== Camel Example Spring Boot MitchConnect

This example shows how to receive and forward SSL encrypted
messages via MLLP. It logs the messages to a SQLite database
in its toplevel directory, so SQLite must be installed.  It also
includes sample yaml routes for sending and receiving without
SSL.

Once you see the "Completed initialization in x ms" message,
you can point a web browser to localhost:8080/api/routes2
to see the loaded routes, and to localhost:8080/api/routes2/load
to load a valid yaml file route
or enter valid yaml text to create a route.

If the entered yaml is not valid it will not load but there
will be no message.  If it is valid you will see it when
your browser is redirected to /api/routes2.

You can Stop and Suspend routes.  Stopped or suspended routes
can be Started.

The application.yaml file is in src/main/resources, and keystore
and truststore and port information is under camel: mllp: ssl:
for the SSL route and camel: mllp: nossl: for the unsecured send
and receive routes.

Beware: this is more a learning experience product than anything
showing best practices.  Still, it provides one path to follow
should you run into trouble getting started on something similar.

=== Help and contributions

This is an in-progress hobby-level effort, and I am by no means
an expert on Camel or Spring Boot.
