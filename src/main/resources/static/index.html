    <h1>Welcome to Mitch Connect</h1>
    <p>
      This program provides an easy way to run basic Camel routes,
      which you can think of as Mirth Connect channels or Rhapsody paths.
      It does not, at least for now, incorporate things like a database browser,
      given that there are excellent database browsers out there.
      It also does not incorporate a visual route builder,
      <a href="https://kaoto.io/">Kaoto</a>
      is open source and already makes that capability available,
      or you can construct yaml routes in any text editor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The route dashboard is at
      <a href="http://localhost:8080/ui/routes">localhost:8080/ui/routes</a> .
      From there you can load and unload, stop, suspend, and start routes.
      The api uses localhost:8080/api/routes2 and is most easily accessed at
  <a href="http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html">localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Message bodies are written using JPA to SQLite3 file route-messages.db,
      table route_messages. Counts of written records by route are at 
      <a href="http://localhost:8080/ui/db/counts">localhost:8080/ui/db/counts</a>.
      (Get the excellent open-source <a href="https://sqlitebrowser.org/">SQLite browser</a> to query the table.)  And because the project uses Spring and JPA,
      you can easily swap out for PostgreSQL or other db's in the configuration.
      Message bodies may be written at multiple points in the route,
      so counts do not currently reflect the number of messages,
      but a GROUP BY exchange_id will change that.
    </p>
    <p>Password protection is weak right now and will
      be replaced; see the keycloak branch at github.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are three preloaded routes.  Their yaml definitions are in 
      folders [root]/src/main/resources/loadedroutes/no_ssl and ...ssl2.
      There are also several routes under [root]/src/main/resources/unloadedroutes,
      and they can be loaded via the "load routes" button above.
    </p>
    <p>
      The MllpSSLForwarding route receives an encrypted HL7v2 message
      on one port,
      forwards it using encryption to another port, and returns the reply
      from the final port to the original sender.
      The truststore and keystore files and passwords are set in
      [root]/src/main/resources/application.yaml,
  under camel: mllp: ssl:  as are the ports to use.
  Initial values are set to retrieve from port 15679 and forward to port 15678
</p> 
<p>
  The No SSL send and receive routes pick up ports from
  [root]/src/main/resources/application.yaml at camel: mllp: no_ssl:
  which are initially set for receiving on 15681 and sending on 15682.
</p>
<p>
  One goal of this project is to provide an Apache Camel "dashboard"
  that will make some sense to users of Mirth Connect
  and enable them to write and experiment with routes written in yaml.
  That's why the preloaded routes involve MLLP, a healthcare-specific
  protocol.  But Camel is capable of talking to just about everything,
  and you can get some idea of that at <a href="https://camel.apache.org/components/4.10.x/index.html">https://camel.apache.org/components/4.10.x/index.html</a>
  Each component is documented, and the Spring Boot Auto-Configuration
  section will show you dependencies needed (see below).
</p>
<h3>Logging</h3>
    <p>Log messages are written to [root]/logs/mitchconnect.log.
    </p>
<h3>Camel components</h3>
<p>
  If you wish to use camel components that are not already built in,
  you'll need to add their dependencies to the pom.xml file.
  Because that file includes the dependency
  camel-spring-boot-starter, yaml routes can use
  the following components without adding dependencies:
  <list>
    <li>bean: Invokes methods on Java beans registered in the Camel registry.
    </li><li>browse: Inspects messages received on endpoints that support browsing.
    </li><li>controlbus: Manages and monitors Camel routes.   
    </li><li>dataformat: Uses Camel data formats as regular Camel components.
    </li><li>dataset: Provides data for load and soak testing.
    </li><li>direct: Calls another endpoint within the same Camel context synchronously.   
    </li><li>language: Executes scripts in various languages supported by Camel (e.g., simple, groovy, etc.).   
    </li><li>log: Logs message data.
    </li><li>mock: Mocks endpoints for testing routes.
    </li><li>ref: Routes messages to endpoints looked up dynamically in the Camel registry.   
    </li><li>rest: Exposes and consumes RESTful services.
    </li><li>saga: Implements the Saga pattern for distributed transactions.
    </li><li>scheduler: Generates messages at specified intervals using java.util.concurrent.ScheduledExecutorService.
    </li><li>seda: Asynchronously calls another endpoint within the same JVM.   
    </li><li>stub: Stubs out physical endpoints during development or testing.
    </li><li>timer: Generates messages at specified intervals using java.util.Timer.
    </li><li>validator: Validates message payloads using XML schema.
    </li><li>xpath: Evaluates XPath expressions.
    </li><li>xslt: Transforms XML payloads using XSLT templates.   
</p>
<h3>About yaml</h3><p>
    <p>Keep in mind that indentation matters in yaml.</p>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/apache/camel-spring-boot-examples/blob/main/aot-basic/routes/demo-route.camel.yaml">Here</a>
      is an example from the extremely helpful camel-spring-boot-examples at <a href="https://github.com/apache/camel-spring-boot-examples/">GitHub</a>.
      <a href="https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_build_of_apache_camel_for_spring_boot/3.20/html/camel_spring_boot_reference/csb-camel-yaml-dsl-component-starter#defining_a_route">Here</a> is one basic intro to get you started, and you can always look at the sample routes under [root]/src/main/resources.,/p>
    <p>You can also ask the various AI chatbots to do up a simple yaml route,
      and see what it generates.</p>
